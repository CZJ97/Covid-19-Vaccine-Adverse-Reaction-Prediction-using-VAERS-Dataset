# Covid-19-Vaccine-Adverse-Reaction-Prediction-using-VAERS-Dataset
To predict whether recipient will died or not using machine learning algorithms. The algorithms used are Logistic Regression, K-NearestNeighbor, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest.

The recall score will be used on this project, the False Negtive meaning that the recipient who predicted not died after died actually they died. The Recall score formula is TP/(TP + FN), so the smallest of FN, the highest of Recall score. 

As a result, it was shown that Artificial Neural Network is the best algorithm to evaluate whether the recipeint after vaccine will died or not. Therefore, it will be chosen for implementation.
